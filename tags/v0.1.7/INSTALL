Before starting with the installation, you should make sure, that all
required libraries and programs are available on your system. tel currently
depends on:

    * Python at least 2.4 - http://www.python.org

Users of debian systems can install these with:

    apt-get install python2.4

If you have completed installing all dependencies, you can install tel by
running the following command:
    
    python setup.py install

This will install tel under /usr. If you want to change the installation
prefix, use the --prefix option:
  
    python setup.py install --prefix /usr/local

A complete list of command line options of the installation script is
available through python setup.py --help.
