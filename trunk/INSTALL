Before starting with the installation, you should make sure, that all
required libraries and programs are available on your system. tel currently
depends on:

    * Python at least 2.5 - http://www.python.org
    * gettext - http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/gettext.html

Users of debian systems can install these with:

    apt-get install python2.5 gettext

If you have completed installing all dependencies, you can install tel by
running the following command:

    python setup.py install

This will install tel under the prefix of your python installation, which is
absolutely recommended.

A complete list of command line options of the installation script is
available through python setup.py --help.
