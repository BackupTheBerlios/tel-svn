* add --force option to suppress warnings and confirmation requests

* edit (and maybe create) should also accepts --fields
- Only for these fields should then be prompted

* implement encryption
- Maybe trough gpg. disadvantage: need for temporary files 
- or is there a python module for gpg?
- trought python-crypto. Disadvantages: no standard, lots of extra work needed

* mark fields, which matched the search pattern

* support sorting for list, show and table command

* import more file formats (mainly vcard)

* allow infinite complex search pattern?
- 'foo in tags and not (john in firstname or 'wallace' in lastname)'

* export to mutt? 
- MightyTux currently writes a little perl program which covers this
