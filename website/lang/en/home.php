<h1>What is tel?</h1>
<p>tel is a little console-based phone book program. It allows adding, modifing, editing and searching of phone book entries right on your terminal. Pretty printing capabilites are also provided.</p>
<p>Entries are stored in simple csv file. This eases import and export with common spread sheet applications like Microsoft Excel or OpenOffice.org Calc.</p>
<p>tel is written in <a href="http://www.python.org">Python</a> and distributed under the <a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php">MIT license</a> and therefore free software. You can download it free of charge, share it with your friends, modify and even sell it.</p>

<h1>History</h1>
<p>Originally tel was a little bash script developed by Pot and <a href="http://www.ubuntuusers.de/users/sabsirro/">sabsirro</a> in the german Ubuntu forum <a href="http://forum.ubuntuusers.de/topic/70328/">ubuntuusers.de</a>. With development continuing at quick pace, bash quickly proved to be insufficient for writing such large projects as tel had now become.</p>

<p>First Pot and sabsirro planned to rewrite tel in Perl. But before development in perl had begun, <a href="http://www.ubuntuusers.de/users/lunar/">lunar</a> <a href="http://forum.ubuntuusers.de/goto?post=589400">came up</a> with a <a href="http://www.python.org">Python</a> version of tel. This version was met with great interest. After a little while Pot and lunar agreed to continue this version as a separate project on <a href="http://developer.berlios.de">BerliOS</a>. When sabsirro joined the project after a little while, the tel developer team was complete.</p>
